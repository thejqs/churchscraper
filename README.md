churchscraper.py
===============


This was a simple project to give a client urls within a given website that contained links to PDF resources as well as the existing links directly to those PDFs as well as copies of the files themselves. 

The client was redesigning the target site -- it belonged to a church --  and did not yet know whether they wanted to redirect urls to existing resources or host those files elsewhere. This little thing gave them the option to do either.
